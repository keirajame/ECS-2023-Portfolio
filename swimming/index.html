	 <p>I have swam for around 8 years.</p>
	  <p>I have swam competitively for almost 6 years.</p>
	  <p>I swam on a rec league team called the "Penguins" from when I was 6 until I was 7. From then on I swam on a rec league called "Hurricanes" 
	  now known as "SeaMonsters" and by the time I was 9 had moved up to their competitive league team named "Legends". I have been swimming with
		  the same coaches now for around 7-8 years.</p>
	  <p>A swimmer I have always looked up to is Katy Ledecky. Katy Ledecky is a 7 time olympic gold medalist and 19 time World Championship gold 
		  medalist. She swims distance freestyle and is known for holding the world record in the 800 and 1500 meter freestyles. She is the most 
		  decorated female swimmer in all of history.</p>
